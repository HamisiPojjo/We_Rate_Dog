# We_Rate_Dog
This is my 2nd Udacity Nanodegree Project


This is a report of Insights and Visualizations extracted from a popular twitter account We_Rate_Dog whereby the data is based rating random dogs out of 10. There can be also a short explanation of the dogs name, among other details concerned with a dog. The dataset was divided into 3 sets: twitter_archive_enhanced.csv,image_predictions.tsv and also a json.txt.

I had to follow the normal procedure of gathering, assessing and cleaning the data so that i can be able to derive insights and findings from it. I would later combine the above dataset to form a master dataframe called twitter_archive_master.csv. It is through the twitter_archive_master.csv dataframe that i have been able to perform my analysis.
